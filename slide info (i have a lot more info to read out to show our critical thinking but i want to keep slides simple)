Context - definition and facts
Topics - giving outline of presentation
Conclusion (contextual) - outlook of the growth of semiconductor companies in a broader context outside of finance
Reflection - HSBC core values, give some personal ones as well

What is AI
AI is the ability of computers and machines to perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence.

What are Semiconductors
Semiconductors are materials that enable modern electronics, powering transistors, chips, and integrated circuits.

Link Between AI & Semiconductors
AI depends on semiconductors (GPUs, TPUs) for massive data processing, while AI growth drives demand for faster, more efficient chips.

Conclusion
- The semiconductor sector underpins global industries and is projected to reach $1T in revenues by 2030.

- Geopolitics poses risks, but digitalisation and AI-driven demand remain the primary growth drivers.

- Innovation in areas like edge computing will continue to reinforce semiconductors’ critical role in the global economy.

Reflections
- We value difference -> supported each other with knowledge gaps
- We succeed togethers -> accepted and reflected on different perspectives, adapted if necessary
- We take responsibility -> have never worked together but took responsibility for this project
- We get it done -> even though none of us had used power BI before, we got things done even if it meant not making use of cool skills we leart such as dashboard making







Extended version 

What is AI

Artificial intelligence (AI), the ability of a digital computer or computer-controlled robot to perform tasks
commonly associated with intelligent beings. https://www.britannica.com/technology/artificial-intelligence

What is Semi Conductors
Semiconductors are a unique class of materials with properties that lie between conductors, 
which allow free flow of electricity, and insulators, which do not. Their distinctive characteristics 
make them indispensable in modern electronics, forming the foundation of devices like transistors, 
diodes, and integrated circuits (ICs). 

Link between both 
The importance of semiconductors in the global economy lies in their ability to process and transmit information. 
Therefore, it makes sense that AI relies on them to to provide the massive processing power needed for tasks like
machine learning and complex data analysis. Hence, semiconductor companies are among the largest in the global stock market.

Semiconductors are essential for AI because they provide 
the specialized hardware, such as GPUs and TPUs, that can efficiently 
process the immense amounts of data and complex calculations required for 
training and running neural networks.  

The relationship between AI and semiconductors is deeply symbiotic. 
AI’s rapid growth fuels the demand for semiconductors that are smaller, faster, 
and more energy-efficient, while semiconductor advancements


Conclusion (contextual, mention in introduction)
- As politics and technology become increasingly entwined, active investors should pay  
close attention to the geopolitical backdrop. However, we believe that fundamentally 
it will be demand – driven by the ongoing digitalisation of the global economy – rather than politics, 
that will primarily influence the path ahead and drive growth in the semiconductor sector.

The semiconductor sector is a major part of the stock market. It's not just a major player by market capitalization but is critical to many industries such as automotive, healthcare, and telecommunications. Disruptions in the industry such as after the pandemic showed its importance across the economy.

One estimate predicts the chips sector could hit $1trn in revenues by the end of this decade as structural demand drivers underpin growth
The geopolitical backdrop remains shaky but we remain convinced
that technology shifts, policy measures and consumer demand will 
continue to favour the sector
An example of the technology shift is the rise of edge computing is another critical trend shaping the future of AI semiconductors. By processing data locally on devices—rather than relying on cloud-based servers—edge computing reduces latency, conserves bandwidth, and enhances privacy. This is particularly vital for real-time AI applications such as autonomous vehicles, industrial automation, and augmented reality. Semiconductor manufacturers are responding by developing chips optimized for edge AI, such as NVIDIA’s Jetson platform and Qualcomm’s Snapdragon AI processors. These chips combine high performance with low power consumption, enabling AI processing at the edge without compromising efficiency.

As highlighted in the introduction, the semiconductor sector sits at the intersection of politics, technology, 
and global economic growth. While geopolitical tensions will continue to shape the industry’s risk landscape, 
history shows that demand—driven by accelerating digitalisation and technological innovation—remains the dominant force. 
From powering critical industries such as automotive, healthcare, and telecommunications, to 
enabling cutting-edge developments in AI and edge computing, semiconductors are central to the functioning 
and future of the global economy. With structural demand drivers expected to propel the industry 
toward $1 trillion in revenues by the end of the decade, we believe that active investors should 
look beyond short-term political headwinds and focus on the sector’s long-term growth potential, 
rooted in its essential role across industries and continuous innovation.
