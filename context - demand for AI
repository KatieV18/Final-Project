AI = computers performing human-like tasks.

Semiconductors = “new oil,” foundation of electronics.

Link: AI relies on GPUs/TPUs → massive processing power.

Demand for AI → drives chip innovation (smaller, faster, efficient)


Politics + tech increasingly linked.

Risks: geopolitics & trade disputes.

But demand + digitalisation + AI adoption = main growth driver.

Industry projected to hit $1T by 2030.
